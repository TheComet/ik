The type of algorithm to use.

There are four solvers available and each has a  specific  use-case  with pros
and cons.
 
  - ik.ONE_BONE rotates a single segment to  point  towards a target position.
                This  is  useful  for  things  like eyeballs, rotating  heads,
                pointing guns in  a direction, etc.
  - ik.TWO_BONE solves the two bone IK problem analytically (1 iteration) and
                is very fast. This is useful for legs, arms, robotic limbs, 
                anything that has a single joint and two bones.
  - ik.FABRIK   is a fast  general purpose IK solver.  Converges  very quickly
                (5-50  iterations), works  with  constraints,  supports target 
                rotations,  supports  multiple  end  effectors.  FABRIK  is  a 
                heuristic  algorithm meaning it isn't  based  on any  physical 
                model  and produces results  that can  "look wrong" on organic 
                creatures. FABRIK  is good at making  small  adjustments, such 
                as foot  placement to match  inclination. It is not a suitable 
                algorithm for driving animations on organic creatures.
  - ik.MSS      is a mass-spring  based  solver.  Produces  excellent  looking
                results for organic creatures and is reasonably fast. Supports
                constraints, target rotations, and multiple end effectors. MSS
                is a  physically  based  model  that is  aware of  the model's
                distribution of mass. Each  joint specifies how "heavy" it is,
                making  heavier  nodes react  slower  than  lighter  nodes  to
                approximate how a real organic joint might behave.
